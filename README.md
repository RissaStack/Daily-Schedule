## Description
This website is to help you organize your daily life. It has the hours color coded so you know what is currently happening, what is coming up, and what you have already done. 

## Challenges
Some of the challenges I exerienced were using local storage to save the data. 

## What I learned
I learned how to create conditional statements to work with the style sheet. I learned how to use dayjs to show the current time and date. I also learned how to save data to the local storage.

## Created with
JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Day.JS
